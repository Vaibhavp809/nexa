# Bubble Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed
- Bubble is draggable (via content.js `makeDraggable()`)
- Position persistence (stored in chrome.storage.local)
- API calls working
- Basic features implemented (Summarize, Translate, Notes, Settings)

## 🔄 In Progress
- **Semicircle Menu**: Need to add menu that appears on bubble click
- **Feature Expansion**: When menu item clicked, expand to show feature panel
- **All Features**: Need to add Voice Notes, Voice Search, Tasks

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Add semicircle menu on bubble click
2. Update bubble to expand to feature panel (not tabs)
3. Port remaining features from frontend
4. Match frontend styling

## Notes
- The bubble currently shows a tabbed panel on click
- We need to change it to show a semicircle menu first
- Then expand to show the selected feature's panel
