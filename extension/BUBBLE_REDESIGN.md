# Bubble Redesign Plan

The bubble needs to be completely redesigned to match the frontend. This involves:

1. **Draggable Bubble** - Already implemented in content.js via `makeDraggable()`
2. **Semicircle Menu** - Menu that appears when bubble is clicked, showing feature icons in a semicircle
3. **All Features** - Port all features from frontend:
   - Summarize
   - Translate (voice + text modes)
   - Quick Notes
   - Voice Notes
   - Voice Search
   - Tasks
   - Settings

## Current Status
- Bubble is draggable ✅
- API calls working ✅
- Features partially implemented ❌
- Semicircle menu missing ❌

## Implementation Priority
1. Add semicircle menu on bubble click
2. Port all features one by one
3. Match frontend styling
